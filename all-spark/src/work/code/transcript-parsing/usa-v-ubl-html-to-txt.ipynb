SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, for the record, as to the\\n\\n  12   spellings, we have no objection to using these spellings as\\n\\n  13   long as it is understood that this is for the convenience of\\n\\n  14   everyone, but it does not necessarily -- it is not necessarily\\n\\n  15   the exact or only spelling.\\n\\n  16   BY MR. FITZGERALD:\\n\\n  17   Q.  Just so we\\'re clear, when the word \"Falastini\" is used,\\n\\n  18   does that mean that the person is Palestinian?\\n\\n  19   A.  Yes, he\\'s from Palestine.\\n\\n  20   Q.  In addition to being trained in firearms and RPGs, can you\\n\\n  21   describe in more detail what training you received with regard\\n\\n  22   to how to use the RPG?\\n\\n  23   A.  Could you repeat the question?\\n\\n  24   Q.  Yes.

RPG, it\\'s for tanks and any plane or helicopter fly around\\n\\n   9   600 meters.\\n\\n  10   Q.  And can you tell us how you would shoot a plane or a\\n\\n  11   helicopter with an RPG?\\n\\n  12   A.  Also, they got math to tell you if the tank move, that\\n\\n  13   means you have to target in front of the tank.  And for\\n\\n  14   civilians, if the tank go 20 miles an hour, that means you\\n\\n  15   make locater and math to see when you target in front, that\\n\\n  16   means it\\'s going to come together.

It\\'s same thing, but because helicopter goes faster than\\n\\n  21   tank, if the helicopter go 200 miles an hour, that means you\\n\\n  22   need 2,000 meter in front of the helicopter.\\n\\n  23   Q.  And later on when you were in Afghanistan, did you ever\\n\\n  24   actually shoot an RPG at a helicopter?\\n\\n  25   A.

He should be\\n\\n  16   present when they make the license for marriage.\\n\\n  17            In Shia, they don\\'t use that.

Yes, Abu Habib al Pakistani and Abu Mohamed al Yemeni.\\n\\n  18   Q.  Does that mean he is from Pakistan?\\n\\n  19   A.  Yes.\\n\\n  20   Q.  The other person you said was?\\n\\n  21   A.  Abu Mohamed al Yemeni.\\n\\n  22   Q.  What happened then?\\n\\n  23   A.  They put the box in the boat and after that, me and Abu\\n\\n  24   Neam, we went.\\n\\n  25   Q.  That was you and Abu Neam, the person you mentioned was\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                340\\n\\n\\n\\n   1   Libyan before?\\n\\n   2   A.  Yes.  He is the truck driver.\\n\\n   3   Q.  Did you ever actually open the crates and look inside\\n\\n   4   yourself and see what was in there?\\n\\n   5   A.  No.\\n\\n   6   Q.  What did they tell you was in the crates?\\n\\n   7   A.  Abu Khabuib al Sudani, he told me it\\'s weapons to Saif\\n\\n   8   Islam Jannubi group in Yemen.\\n\\n   9   Q.  The person who told you that the weapons were going to the\\n\\n  10   Saif Islam Jannubi group was whom?\\n\\n  11   A.  Abu Khabuib al Sudani.\\n\\n  12   Q.

My analysis?\\n\\n   7   Q.  What was your understanding at the time --\\n\\n   8            MR. SCHMIDT:  Objection, your Honor.\\n\\n   9   Q.  -- what the weapons were to be used for?\\n\\n  10            THE COURT:  Overruled.\\n\\n  11   A.  What I believe at that time, they want to use it against\\n\\n  12   foreign army and American army in east Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n  13   Q.  Do you know in fact whether or not anything in those boxes\\n\\n  14   or crates was ever used against the American military in Saudi\\n\\n  15   Arabia?\\n\\n  16   A.  No.\\n\\n  17            (Continued on next page)\\n\\n  18\\n\\n  19\\n\\n  20\\n\\n  21\\n\\n  22\\n\\n  23\\n\\n  24\\n\\n  25\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                342\\n\\n\\n\\n   1            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I believe we have a\\n\\n   2   stipulation with the defense from yesterday that it is not the\\n\\n   3   government\\'s contention that anything contained in those\\n\\n   4   crates was ever in fact used against the American military in\\n\\n   5   Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n   6            THE COURT:  Very well.  So stipulated.\\n\\n   7            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, I am at a convenient\\n\\n   8   breaking point.\\n\\n   9            THE COURT:  Yes.  We will stop now.\\n\\n  10            I remind you, a stipulation is an agreement between\\n\\n  11   the parties that a certain fact is true, and so the parties\\n\\n  12   have stipulated that these weapons were never used against\\n\\n  13   Americans.\\n\\n  14            We will call it a day, and tomorrow may be less than\\n\\n  15   a full day.  I don\\'t know exactly how late we will sit\\n\\n  16   tomorrow.  I know it will not be a full day.\\n\\n  17            Have a good evening.  Please remember what I said\\n\\n  18   about not reading or listening to anything about the case.\\n\\n  19            (Jury excused)\\n\\n  20            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, among the last questions\\n\\n  21   answered by this witness was his speculation that the weapons\\n\\n  22   were going to Saudi Arabia to be used against Americans,\\n\\n  23   notwithstanding that he was told that it was going to Yemen.\\n\\n  24   In our previous discussions it was my understanding that the\\n\\n  25   witness was going to testify that he was told that it was\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                343\\n\\n\\n\\n   1   going to Saudi Arabia, and then we had the stipulation that\\n\\n   2   there was no proof that it would be used against the\\n\\n   3   Americans.\\n\\n   4            There is a difference between being told something\\n\\n   5   and then having a stipulation as opposed to asking this\\n\\n   6   witness based on no facts to speculate what he thought where\\n\\n   7   the weapons were going, when there is contrary evidence based\\n\\n   8   on statements made to him by other al Qaeda members that it\\n\\n   9   was going to Yemen to fight the Yemeni Communists.\\n\\n  10            So I would ask his answer to be stricken concerning\\n\\n  11   his speculation.\\n\\n  12            THE COURT:  We go up the hill and down the hill.\\n\\n  13            MR. SCHMIDT:  They shouldn\\'t have gone up the hill in\\n\\n  14   the first place.  That is opposite of what he has been told is\\n\\n  15   sheer speculation.  That should not have been elicited.\\n\\n  16            MR. FITZGERALD:  Your Honor, my understanding, and\\n\\n  17   perhaps it wasn\\'t clear, is that that shipment of weapons and\\n\\n  18   explosives was going to Yemen to be used against the\\n\\n  19   Communists, but part was being broken off to go to Saudi\\n\\n  20   Arabia to be used against particular persons in the American\\n\\n  21   military.  That was his understanding.  It was elicited as\\n\\n  22   impeachment material because this witness participated in\\n\\n  23   conduct against the American military.  He then pled guilty to\\n\\n  24   a charge of that, and we brought out that in fact the\\n\\n  25   explosives were not used for that purpose.  There were two\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                344\\n\\n\\n\\n   1   different destinations for weapons and explosives.  We brought\\n\\n   2   both out.  We impeached the witness to make clear that he\\n\\n   3   engaged in criminal conduct and clarified that in fact the\\n\\n   4   weapons were not used against the American military.  Just as\\n\\n   5   when Mr. Schmidt objected to the basis of the hearsay for the\\n\\n   6   informant, I was careful not to elicit what we agreed to bring\\n\\n   7   out.\\n\\n   8            THE COURT:  Let\\'s review this again when we see the\\n\\n   9   transcript of what was said, because it certainly was not very\\n\\n  10   clear.\\n\\n  11            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.\\n\\n  12            THE COURT:  Reserve your objection, remind me, and as\\n\\n  13   soon as we get the transcript we can see if anything needs to\\n\\n  14   be clarified.  I don\\'t think there is any real disagreement as\\n\\n  15   to the substance, but we will see.\\n\\n  16            MR. SCHMIDT:  One other thing, your Honor.  I renew\\n\\n  17   our application in limine concerning the hearsay from alleged\\n\\n  18   coconspirators based on the lack of a definitive source.  For\\n\\n  19   example, all testimony related to the committee in England is\\n\\n  20   based on something said by this person Nalfi, but we don\\'t\\n\\n  21   know where his source of information is from.  We made that\\n\\n  22   application obviously in greater detail yesterday, but it\\n\\n  23   appears that the government is continuing to elicit\\n\\n  24   information based not only on hearsay from an alleged al Qaeda\\n\\n  25   declarant but where that declarant\\'s source of information is\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                345\\n\\n\\n\\n   1   not clear.  That is my objection.  I renew that objection.\\n\\n   2            THE COURT:  It is overruled.  I think that there was\\n\\n   3   a question as to what the source was of this witness\\'s\\n\\n   4   knowledge.  He was required to state it, and he responded.\\n\\n   5            In five minutes I would like to see counsel for El\\n\\n   6   Hage and the government, and the purpose of that is for me to\\n\\n   7   be a little more focused on matters that we are going to deal\\n\\n   8   with on Thursday.  Otherwise we are adjourned until 10:00 a.m.\\n\\n   9            (Robing room conference sealed and filed under\\n\\n  10   separate cover)\\n\\n  11            (Proceedings adjourned until 10:00 a.m., Wednesday,\\n\\n  12   February 7, 2001)\\n\\n  13\\n\\n  14\\n\\n  15\\n\\n  16\\n\\n  17\\n\\n  18\\n\\n  19\\n\\n  20\\n\\n  21\\n\\n  22\\n\\n  23\\n\\n  24\\n\\n  25\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                346\\n\\n\\n\\n   1\\n\\n   2                        INDEX OF EXAMINATION\\n\\n   3   Witness                    D      X      RD     RX\\n\\n   4   JAMAL AHMED AL-FADL......161\\n\\n   5                        GOVERNMENT EXHIBITS\\n\\n   6   Exhibit No.                                     Received\\n\\n   7    100 .........................................227\\n\\n   8    101 .........................................228\\n\\n   9    105 .........................................229\\n\\n  10    103 .........................................229\\n\\n  11    106 .........................................230\\n\\n  12    90 ..........................................231\\n\\n  13    104 .........................................272\\n\\n  14\\n\\n  15\\n\\n  16\\n\\n  17\\n\\n  18\\n\\n  19\\n\\n  20\\n\\n  21\\n\\n  22\\n\\n  23\\n\\n  24\\n\\n  25\\n\\n\\n  \\n'"
